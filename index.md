## About Me

I am a Fulbright scholar seeking Ph.D. positions starting Fall 2025. I have experiences with GPUs and hardware-software co-design, and academic training across the computing stack. I aim to study **computing systems with heterogeneous components**, with respect to concrete applications like AI or data systems. I see my Ph.D. as a joyful chance to build, experiment and learn - rolling up my sleeves to create working system prototypes that span multiple layers of the stack!

## Research Interests

- **Computer Architecture and Systems:** chaining specialized cores, reconfigurablity, heterogeneous memory/IO subsystem, design automation

### Prior Experiences
- GPU acceleration, NPU hw-sw co-design, xv6 kernel hacking, Analog computing tape-out, Pipelined CPU prototyping.
{% comment %}
- Exploring alternative mechanisms for computing, I demonstrated [analog computing](https://github.com/sunwookim028/analog-fourier/) Fourier series.
- Discovering X, Y.
{% endcomment %}

### Potential Directions
- accelerator integration aware system-wide design
	- e.g. taming acc. cost, where to run OS
- abstracting various tech options to unified interface
    - e.g. het. storage engine, memory pooling, multilingual backends for compilers / frameworks (PyTorch APIs)
- finding appropriate domain then vertically optimizing
	- e.g. FPGA & algorithm co-evolution, quantum comm., DNA storage engines
- EDA/dev solutions to aid design decisions within complex design space
	- e.g. faster & richer FPGA dev cycle, ML in kernels / CAD / NAS

## News

- **[Sept. 2024]** I am grateful to be nominated as a Fulbright scholar and receive financial support for my doctoral studies in U.S.
