## About Me

I am a Fulbright scholar seeking Ph.D. positions starting Fall 2025. I have experiences with GPUs and hardware-software co-design, and academic training across the computing stack. I aim to study **computing systems with heterogeneous components**, with respect to concrete applications like AI or data systems. I see my Ph.D. as a joyful chance to build, experiment and learn - rolling up my sleeves to create working system prototypes that span multiple layers of the stack!

## Research Interests

- **Computer Architecture and Systems:** chaining specialized cores, reconfigurablity, heterogeneous memory/IO subsystem, design automation

## News

- **[Sept. 2024]** I am grateful to be nominated as a Fulbright scholar and receive financial support for graduate studies in U.S.
