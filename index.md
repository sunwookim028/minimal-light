## About Me

I am a Fulbright scholar seeking Ph.D. positions starting Fall 2025. I have experiences with GPUs and hardware-software co-design, and academic training across the computing stack. I aim to study **computing systems with heterogeneous components**, with respect to concrete applications like AI or data systems. I see my Ph.D. as a joyful chance to build, experiment and learn - rolling up my sleeves to create working system prototypes that span multiple layers of the stack!

## Research Interests

- **Computer Architecture and Systems:** chaining specialized cores, reconfigurablity, heterogeneous memory/IO subsystem, design automation

### Prior Experiences
- GPU acceleration, NPU hw-sw co-design, xv6 kernel hacking, Analog computing tape-out, Pipelined CPU prototyping.
{% comment %}
- Exploring alternative mechanisms for computing, I demonstrated [analog computing](https://github.com/sunwookim028/analog-fourier/) Fourier series.
- Discovering X, Y.

### Potential Thrusts
- Accelerator-rich Systems
    - **acc. integration aware system-wide design** e.g. taming acc. cost, where to run OS
    - **extending acc.s for wider utility** e.g. for evolving/compound workloads, CXL NMP & expander form, NPUs for linear algebra or graph workloads, virtualization, programmability & reconfigurability

- Easy-to-use Heterogeneous Systems
    - **unifying the interface** e.g. het. storage engine, memory pooling, language/framework and compilers supporting multiple machines (PyTorch)
    - **EDA/dev tools, ML adoption** e.g. richer & faster FPGA iterations, HLS/DSLs, ML for arch/OS policies/circuits

- Application-oriented Specialized Systems 
    - **vertical co-optimization** e.g. FPGA & algorithm co-evolution, quantum comm., DNA storage engines, robotics

## News

- **[Sept. 2024]** I am grateful to be nominated as a Fulbright scholar and receive financial support for my doctoral studies in U.S.
